# Calculator

This repository contains a demonstration of test-driven development (TTD) using Java and JUnit. The code in
this repository implements a simple calculator that can evaluate basic mathematical expressions.

The repository includes a src directory containing the Java source code for the calculator, as well as a tests
directory containing JUnit tests for the calculator. The tests in the tests directory were written using the
TTD approach, where tests are written before the implementation code in order to drive the development process.
