Fifth Release

This release fixes several bugs.

- Fixed when the application was first run even though infix type of evaluation method was chosen it wasn't automatically chosen.
- Fixed when you typed a postfix expression and postfix button was pressed it still gave InvalidExpression. 
- Fixed when there was a bracket inside an infix expression it used to return that it was a postfix expression.
